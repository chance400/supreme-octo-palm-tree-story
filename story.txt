Once upon a time lived a man named Urg. Urg was the only one in his village who knew how to take care of crops. Without Urg, the entire village would perish. Why, then, had he never taught someone else how to care for the crops? Surely others must have asked him to teach them before... but that was not the case. Urg was actually very frightening and no man would ever consider conversing with him.
However, Urg was a very lonely man who only wished that others would come to know him. Little did he know that his luck was about to change.
